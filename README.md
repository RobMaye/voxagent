# VoxAgent

VoxAgent is an open-source library for in-stream live action parsing in voice-based applications. It's designed to embed agentic capabilities into real-time voice streams, allowing for dynamic interaction and response generation.

## Overview

VoxAgent processes audio streams in real-time, parsing speech and actions to enable intelligent, context-aware responses. It's particularly suited for applications requiring immediate, adaptive interactions based on voice input.

## Current State

- Active development
- Framework for extensibility in progress
- Focus on real-time, in-stream processing

## Features

- Live action parsing within audio streams
- Real-time voice-to-text and text-to-speech conversion
- Dynamic action recognition and execution
- Integration with AI models for intelligent response generation

## Getting Started

To run VoxAgent locally:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Development

This project is in its early stages. The API and features are subject to change as we refine the framework.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. As we work towards a stable release, feel free to experiment with the code and provide feedback through issues or PRs.
